# Software Requirements

You must have this installed on your computer:

- Python 3 from <https://www.python.org/downloads>.
  ```
  python --version
  ```
or
  ```
  python3 --version
  ```
- Pip, which we use to install Python libraries. Pip should be bundled with the Python installation. Verify this by executing this command in a terminal/console:
  ```
  pip --version
  ```
or
  ```
  pip3 --version
  ```
_You can develop a bot without Pip but you have to skip **Step 1**_
- Any IDE with Python support, for example the community edition of [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download).
